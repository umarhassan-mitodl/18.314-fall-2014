Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook Bona, Miklos. _A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory_. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=TzJ2L9ZmlQUC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

A problem marked by \* is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.

Problem Set 9
-------------

*   Due in Session 25
*   Practice Problems
    *   Session 22: Chapter 10: Exercises 1, 2, 7. 7 is quite difficult.
    *   Session 23: Chapter 10: Exercises 6, 7, 12, 20
    *   Session 24: None
*   Problems Assigned in the Textbook
    *   Chapter 10: Exercises 22, 27, 36, 39, 43. In exercise 27, it is not clear what "cross each other" means. What you should prove is that all longest paths have a vertex in common. (This is rather tricky.) For this problem you may assume the result of 26. (As a bonus, you could include a solution to 26). For 43, give a simple combinatorial argument based on Theorem 10.7.
*   Additional Problems
    *   (A13\*) Give an example of a simple graph with exactly three automorphisms. Note that the graph _K_{{< sub "3" >}} (a triangle) has _six_ automorphisms.
*   Bonus Problems
    *   None
