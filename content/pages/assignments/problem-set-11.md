Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook Bona, Miklos. _A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory_. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?

A problem marked by \* is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.

Problem Set 11
--------------

*   Due in Session 33
*   Practice Problems
    *   Session 30:
        
        *   Let _G_ be a bipartite graph with bipartition (_X,Y_). Show that the following three conditions are equivalent.
            *   _G_ is connected, and each edge of _G_ is contained in a perfect matching.
            *   For any _x_ in _X_ and _y_ in _Y_, _G-x-y_ has a perfect matching.
            *   _X_ = _Y_, and for every nonempty subset _T_ of _X_ except _X_, we have _N_(_T_) > _T_.
        
        *   Let _M_ be an _m_×_n_ matrix of 0's and 1's. Let _a_(_M_) be the maximum number of 1's of _M_ such that no two are in the same row or column. Let _b_(_M_) be the minimum number of rows and columns of _M_ such that cover every 1 (i.e., every one is in at least one of the rows or columns). Show that _a_(_M_) = _b_(_M_). (**Hint.** Use the Konig-Egervary theorem.)
    *   Session 31: None
    *   Session 32: Chapter 11: Exercises 6, 7
*   Problems Assigned in the Textbook
    *   Chapter 11: Exercise 30. **Hint.** Consider the operation ⊕ as used in the proof of Theorem 11.14 on page 260.
    *   Chapter 11: Exercises 23, 24
*   Additional Problems
    *   (A17) Let _G_ be a bipartite graph for which a maximum matching has _n_ edges. What is the smallest possible size of a _maximal_ matching? (You need to give an example of this size and prove that no smaller size is possible in any bipartite graph for which a maximum matching has _n_ edges.)
    *   (A18)  Let _G_ and _H_ be finite graphs. Let _K_ consist of the union of _G_ and _H_, with an edge _e_ of _G_ identified with an edge _f_ of _H_. (Thus if _G_ has _q_ edges and _H_ has _r_ edges, then _K_ has _q+r-1_ edges.) Express the chromatic polynomial of _K_ in terms of those of _G_ and _H_. Example:

    *   (B4) Let _M_ be an _n_×_n_ matrix of nonnegative integers. What is the least positive integer _f_(_n_) with the following property? If every row and column of _M_ sums to _f_(_n_), then there exists _n_ entries of _M_, no two in the same row and column, and all greater than one. For instance _f_(2)=3 and _f_(3)=5. The matrix with rows \[2,1,1\], \[2,1,1\], \[0,2,2\] shows that _f_(3)>4.
