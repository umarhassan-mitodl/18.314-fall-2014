Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook Bona, Miklos. *A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory*. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. \[Preview with [\[Google Books\]](https://books.google.com/books?id=TzJ2L9ZmlQUC&pg=PAfrontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false)\]

A problem marked by \* is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.

## Problem Set 12

- Due in Session 37
- Practice Problems
    - Session 33: Chapter 12: Exercises 1, 3, 4, 10
    - Session 34: None
    - Session 35: Chapter 12: Exercise 22
    - Session 36: Chapter 12: Exercises 7, 8, 9
    - Session 37: Chapter 13: Exercises 4, 6, 7, 8. By "the space," the author means three-dimensional Euclidean space. (It is common to say "the plane" for the Euclidean plane, but I never heard "the space" before.)
        - Non-practice" problems, but not to be handed in: Chapter 13: Exercises 20, 24, 38 in 24, the phrase "five persons on the bus who know at least four of the other passengers" means "five persons on the bus, *each* of whom know at least four of the other passengers". The definition of a permutation of an infinite set *S* in 38 is vague and incorrect. Regard a permutation of the positive integers as a sequence *a*{{< sub "1" >}}, *a*{{< sub "2" >}}, … of positive integers such that every positive integer occurs exactly once. We say that this sequence *contains* an increasing arithmetic progression of length three if there exist *i*\<*j*\<*k* such that *a*{{< sub "_i_" >}}, *a*{{< sub "_k_" >}} is an increasing arithmetic progression.
- Problems Assigned in the Textbook
    - Chapter 12: Exercises 13, 18, 19, 20, 21. For 20, note that it is o.k. for *p*{{< sub "_a_" >}}\=0 or *p*{{< sub "_b_" >}}\=0.
- Additional Problems
    - (A19) Let *n*≥4. Suppose that *P* is a convex polyhedron with one *n*\-vertex face and two additional vertices. What is the most number of faces that *P* can have?
    - (A20) Show that the complete graph *K*{{< sub "7" >}} can be embedded on a torus without crossing edges. Draw the torus as a square (or rectangle) with opposite edges identified.
    - (A21\*) Find a triangle-free graph (i.e., no three vertices that are pairwise adjacent) with chromatic number four. Try to use as few vertices as possible.
- Bonus Problems
    - (B5) Find three states of the United States with the property that there exist three points in common to all three of them. **Note**. Suppose we choose a point in the interior of each of the states and join it to the three intersection points. Why does this not give a planar embedding of *K*{{< sub "3" >}}*,*{{< sub "_3_" >}}?
