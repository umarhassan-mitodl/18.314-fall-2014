Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook Bona, Miklos. _A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory_. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=TzJ2L9ZmlQUC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

A problem marked by \* is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.

Problem Set 1
-------------

*   Due in Session 3
*   Practice Problems
    *   Session 1: Chapter 1: Exercises 1, 6a, 8\*, 12 Some of these problems can be done in other ways, but the idea is to give a proof using the pigeonhole principle.
    *   Session 2: Chapter 2: Exercises 2, 5, 12, 15\*, Chapter 3: Exercise 2
*   Problems Assigned in the Textbook
    *   Chapter 1: Exercises 22, 26, 31. In 26, a "regular" triangle is an equilateral triangle. Solve 31(a) for _every_ value of _n_â‰¥2, not just some particular value. 31(b) is rather tricky.
    *   Chapter 2: Exercises 18, 29, 33
    *   Chapter 3: Exercises 27, 34
*   Additional Problems
    *   None
*   Bonus Problems
    *   None
