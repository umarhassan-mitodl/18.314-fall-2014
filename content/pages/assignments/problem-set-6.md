Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook Bona, Miklos. *A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory*. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=TzJ2L9ZmlQUC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

A problem marked by \* is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.

## Problem Set 6

- Due in Session 17
- Practice Problems
    - Session 14: Chapter 8: Exercises 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 14\*
        - Additional practice problem: Let *f*(*n*) denote the number of permutations *π* of 1,2,…,*n* such that for all 1≤*i*≤*n* we have π(*i*) = *i*\-1, *i*, *i*+1, or *i*+2. (Set *f*(0)=1.) For instance, *f*(3)=4, the four permutations being 123, 132, 213, 312. Find the generating function *G*(*x*) = Σ{{< sub "_n_≥0" >}} f(*n*)*x*{{< sub "_n_" >}}. You do not need to find a formula for *f*(*n*). What if we do not allow fixed points, i.e., we exclude π(*i*)=*i*? **Hint.** Consider the digraph of π where we write the vertices 1,2,…,n in a line.
    - Session 15: None from textbook
        - (additional practice problem): Suppose we have 2\_n\_ points on the circumference of a circle. Show that the number of ways we can draw *n noncrossing* diagonals connecting the points, such that each of the points is an endpoint of one of the diagonals, is equal to the Catalan number *C*{{< sub "_n_" >}}. Give a bijection with ballot sequences of length 2\_n\_. (Ballot sequences and Catalan numbers were discussed in class.)
- Problems Assigned in the Textbook
    - Chapter 8: Exercises 24, 26, 35. In 24 use generating functions. Do not simply guess the answer and verify that it is correct. In 35, *H*{{< sub "_n_" >}} should be *h*{{< sub "_n_" >}}. Also find a simple explicit formula for *h*{{< sub "_n_" >}}.
- Additional Problems
    - (A7) Let *f*(*n*) be the number of ways to stack pennies against a flat wall as follows: the bottom level consists of a row of *n* pennies, each tangent to its neighbor(s). A penny may be placed in a higher row if it is supported by two pennies below it. Here is {{% resource_link "90d9aa1e-1be1-2346-83e3-7e4587a8c2c5" "an example (PDF)" %}} for *n*\=10 and for all five possibilities when *n*\=3. Show that *f*(*n*)=*C*{{< sub "_n_" >}}, a Catalan number. (One of many methods is to give a bijection with the Dyck paths discussed in class.)
