Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook Bona, Miklos. _A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory_. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=TzJ2L9ZmlQUC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

A problem marked by \* is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.

Problem Set 2
-------------

*   Due in Session 6
*   Practice Problems
    *   Session 3: Chapter 3: Exercises 8, 9, 12, 18, 23, 24\*
    *   Session 4: Chapter 4: Exercises 3, 13, 16, 26
    *   Session 5: Chapter 5: Exercises 6, 7, 8
*   Problems Assigned in the Textbook
    *   Chapter 3: Exercises 38\*, 41, 49. In my opinion Problem 38 does not deserve its (+), while 41 might need it.
    *   Chapter 4: Exercises 29, 39, 53\*. Naturally in 53 you shouldn't use a computer, calculator, etc. **Hint** for 53: Consider also √11-√10.
    *   Chapter 5: Exercises 23, 35 in 35, find a formula for _a_{{< sub "_n_" >}} in terms of Fibonacci numbers.
*   Additional Problems
    *   (A1) Find the number _b_{{< sub "_n_" >}} of compositions of the positive integer _n_ into odd parts. Express your answer in terms of Fibonacci numbers.
*   Bonus Problems
