Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook, Bona, Miklos. _A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory_. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?

A problem marked by \* is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.

Problem Set 10
--------------

*   Due in Session 30
*   Practice Problems
    *   Session 25: Chapter 10: Exercise 17
    *   Session 26: Chapter 11: Exercise 3
    *   Session 27: Chapter 11: Exercise 3
    *   Session 28: Chapter 11: Exercises 4, 9, 12, 15, 16
*   Problems Assigned in the Textbook
    *   Do problems 1 and 2 from the {{% resource_link 2724112e-a366-79f8-2dc0-4f0b2f4f355e "Matrix-Tree Theorem (PDF)" %}}. Problem 2 deserves a star (\*). For this problem, you will need the concept of the _dual_ of a planar graph, defined in Definition 12.12, pp. 282, of the text. The first step is to prove that if _G_ is a planar graph, then κ(_G_) = κ(_G_\*). If you are unable to show that κ(_G_) = κ(_G_)\*, you should just assume it and continue with the problem.
    *   Chapter 11: Exercise 26. 26(a) is pretty easy, but 26(b) is difficult.
*   Additional Problems
    *   (A14\*) Let _G_{{< sub "n" >}} denote the complete graph _K_{{< sub "_2n_" >}} with _n_ vertex-disjoint edges (i.e., a complete matching) removed. Use the Matrix-Tree theorem to find κ(_G_{{< sub "n" >}}), the number of spanning trees of _G_{{< sub "_n_" >}}. (This is not so easy. Find the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix _L_ of _G_. Several tricks are needed.)
    *   (A15) Let _m_ and _n_ be two positive integers. Find the number of Hamiltonian cycles of the complete bipartite graph _K{{< sub "m" >}}_{{< sub "_,n_" >}}. (There will be two completely different cases.)
    *   (A16) (a) Let _G_ be the _infinite_ graph whose vertices are the points (_i_,_j_) in the plane with integer coordinates, and with an edge between two vertices if the distance between them is one. Is _G_ bipartite? (b\*) What if the vertices are the same as (a), but now there is an edge between two vertices if the distance between them is an odd integer?
