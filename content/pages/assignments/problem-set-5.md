Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook Bona, Miklos. _A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory_. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=TzJ2L9ZmlQUC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

A problem marked by \* is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.

Problem Set 5
-------------

*   Due in Session 14
*   Practice Problems
    *   Session 11: Chapter 7: Exercises 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13
    *   Session 12: None
    *   Session 13: Chapter 8: Exercises 8, 15, 16\*
        *   Additional practice problem: Let _f_(_n_) be the number of ways to choose a composition of _n_ and then color each odd part either red or blue. For instance, when _n_\=3 there are two ways to color the compositions 3, 2+1, and 1+2 (so six in all) and eight ways to color 1+1+1. Thus _f_(3)=14. Find Σ{{< sub "_n_≥1" >}} _f_(_n_)_x_{{< sup "{{< sub \"_n_\" >}}" >}}, and find a formula for _f_(_n_). Your formula for _f_(_n_) should involve √3. **Hint.** Use Theorem 8.13.

    *   None
*   Bonus Problems
    *   (B1) Let _E_{{< sub "_n_" >}} denote the number of permutations _a_{{< sub "1" >}}_a_{{< sub "2" >}}…_a_{{< sub "n" >}} of 1,2,…,_n_ such that _a_{{< sub "1" >}}\>_a_{{< sub "2" >}}\<_a_{{< sub "3" >}}\> _a_{{< sub "4" >}}\<…. (The signs > and \< alternate.) For instance, _E_{{< sub "4" >}}\=5, corresponding to 2143, 3142, 3241, 4132, 4231. Show that for _n_\>0,  
        _E_{{< sub "2" >}}_{{< sub "n" >}}_ = {2_n_\\choose 2}_E_{{< sub "2" >}}_{{< sub "n" >}}_{{< sub "\-2" >}} - {2_n_\\choose 4}_E_2{{< sub "_n_\-4" >}} + {2_n_\\choose 6}_E_{{< sub "2_n_\-6" >}} - ….  
        Deduce from this recurrence a simple formula for the generating function Σ{{< sub "_n_≥0" >}} _E_{{< sub "2_n_" >}} _x_{{< sup "{{< sub \"2_n_\" >}}" >}}/(2_n_)!.

Recall that bonus problems do not count toward your problem set grade. You can hand them in "for fun" to be graded. Perhaps they will come in handy if your grade at the end of the course is a close decision.
